This repository contains all the files and code related to the capstone project, which aims to predict the successful landing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage using data science and machine learning techniques. The project involves data collection, analysis, and the development of machine learning models to forecast the landing success, providing insights for potential competitors in the rocket launch industry.

## Project Overview
SpaceX has reduced the cost of space travel by reusing the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage, bringing down the cost of each launch to 62 million dollars. This project focuses on predicting whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land, which is crucial for reducing launch costs. The insights gained from this project can help companies to make data-driven decisions when planning rocket launches.
